# Extensions: Personality Types
The base game involves making a pet with the creation UI and then periodically feeding the pet to keep it from reaching 0 mood level. Randomly, upon creation, a pet will be given one of 4 personalities that effect different aspects of the game. Patient and impatient effect the mood depletion of pets when they haven't been fed. Hungry decreases the effectiveness of feeding your pet. Cheerful creates a pet at max happiness, as opposed to the default 80%
